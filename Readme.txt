What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is the field of study that enables computers to see and identify digital images and videos as a human would. The challenges it faces largely follow from the limited understanding of biological vision. Computer Vision involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images to extract high-dimensional data from the real world in order to generate symbolic or numerical information which can then be used to make decisions. The process often includes practices like object recognition, video tracking, motion estimation, and image restoration.

What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks TensorFlow, Caffe, and PyTorch.

What is a CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep neural network (DNN) widely used for the purposes of image recognition and processing and NLP. Also known as a ConvNet, a CNN has input and output layers, and multiple hidden layers, many of which are convolutional. In a way, CNNs are regularized multilayer perceptrons.

Gender and Age Detection Python Project- Objective
To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

The convolutional neural network for this python project has 3 convolutional layers:

Convolutional layer; 96 nodes, kernel size 7
Convolutional layer; 256 nodes, kernel size 5
Convolutional layer; 384 nodes, kernel size 3
